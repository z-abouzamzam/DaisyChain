About
-----
This project was originally created up during CodeDay LA. What it aims to do is to play a YouTube video simultaneously on two or more devices, with the end goal being able to daisy chain the video across devices. This creates a surround sound feeling among the devices, and allows for a multiple speaker effect without having a dedicated speaker.

The code uses Alamofire for networking between devices. It uses the YouTube API to get videos. This code was working fully at one point in time, however, users have reported trouble with some features after pulling the files. The code is designed to work after proper dependencies are installed.
